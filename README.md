# Important note
As far as im aware, no one is using this library yet, and there isnt a high demand for it. Therefore i develop this library on per use basis and will not put my full focus on it. If you do plan on using this library but cant because of its in-development status. Please make a GH issue so im aware someones actually waiting on this. As of right now, this library is NOT ready for (production) usage yet
